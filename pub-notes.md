Repetitions of the same task with dfifferent models and with or without memory for quantitative results

Trying with variations of the world with different location locations for the same task

Attempt different tasks (in the sense of having the same task but with different phrasing)
    e.g. clean up and put the objects away
As well as different tasks (not all would be putting things away?)
    50-50 different phrasing and different tasks

Do we need to monitor this manually? Automated tests?
    PyBullet location tests

Declare the modifications and changes made to Qwen if we do end up using Qwen for the evaluation

ICRA

-----------------
during tests, check number of tool calls and success (model belief and actual truth) as metrics

potential tasks:
    put stuff in shelf
    swap items
    leave room
    reorder in shelf

world:
    standard world
    randomized world (wish)
