	Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as decision-making components in embodied AI, yet their integration into robotic systems remains underexplored. This project investigates how an LLM can serve as the cognitive core of a simulated mobile manipulator operating in a household environment. The agent is embodied in PyBullet based simulation as a mobile manipulator with an omnidirectional base and a 7-DoF robotic arm. It can interact with its environment through a set of high-level tool functions for perception, reasoning, navigation, grasping, and placement. Two household tasks, object placement and shelf reordering, were designed to evaluate the agentâ€™s reasoning, planning, and memory utilization. Results demonstrate that the LLM-driven agent can complete structured tasks and adapt strategies, but also reveal limitations such as task refusal and difficulties in managing complex tasks including non obvious subtasks. These findings highlight both the potential and challenges of employing LLMs as embodied cognitive controllers for autonomous robots.
